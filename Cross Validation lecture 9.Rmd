# Cross Validation

## Syntac for `cv.glm()`

- the function `cv.glm()` calculates estimated k-fold cross-validation prediction error for generalized liner models:
- `cv.glm(data, glmfit, cost, k)`
- `data`: matrix or data from containing the full dataset
- `glmfit`: object containing results of `glm()` fitted to `data`
- `cost`: function specifying cost function (default is MSE)
- `K`: number of folds to split data into (default is n)
- thus, we don't need to set `cost` at all, or `K` if we want to use LOOCV.

#### still using `Advertising` dataset for linear regression
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(Advertising)
```

## Perfroming LOOCV with linear regression
- we just used `glm()` to fit linear regression model to predict `sales` from `TV`, `radio`, and `newspaper`:
```{r}
glm.fit = gml(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper)
```
