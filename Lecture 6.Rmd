# Linear Regression part 2

- residual standard error (RSE)

### R^2 statistic

- Residual standard error (RSE) is the standard deviation of residuals or spread of residuals

- $R^2$ statistic is the proportion of variance in Y explained from X.

## Using R for simple linear regresssion
- the function `lm()` fits a simple linear regression model:
`lm(formula, data, ...)`
- The only required argument is formula, which takes the value of an object of class “formula” that looks like:
𝑌 ~ 𝑋

# Lecture from 10-17-21 is week 6

## goes over Homework 2
- **will be able to do all of hw2 after linear regression part 2 lecture is done**
- Input 𝑋: Often multidimensional, in which each dimension is referred to as a feature, predictor, or independent variable
Output 𝑌: The response or dependent variable
- will go over simple linear regression again during this lecture
