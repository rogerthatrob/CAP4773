# Linear Regression part 2

- residual standard error (RSE)

### R^2 statistic

- Residual standard error (RSE) is the standard deviation of residuals or spread of residuals

- $R^2$ statistic is the proportion of variance in Y explained from X.

## Using R for simple linear regresssion
- the function `lm()` fits a simple linear regression model:
`lm(formula, data, ...)`
- The only required argument is formula, which takes the value of an object of class “formula” that looks like:
𝑌 ~ 𝑋

# Lecture from 10-17-21 is week 6

## goes over Homework 2
- **will be able to do all of hw2 after linear regression part 2 lecture is done**
- Input 𝑋: Often multidimensional, in which each dimension is referred to as a feature, predictor, or independent variable
Output 𝑌: The response or dependent variable
- will go over simple linear regression again during this lecture
- will go through most of this today with the advertising data set

### What we have done so far with the Advertising dataset
##### discussed this process conceptually in part one now want to do it in R
- Goal was to predict sales (𝑌) from TV (𝑋)
- Fit simple linear model $𝑌 = 𝛽_0 + 𝛽_1𝑋$ to training data
- Obtained  $𝛽(hat)_0 $and$𝛽(hat)_1$ that minimize RSS (least squares regression line)
- Made predictions from least squares regression line  
- Obtained 95% confidence intervals for$𝛽_0$ and$𝛽_1$
- Tested null hypothesis $H_0:𝛽_1 = 0$ (*can do the same for $𝛽_0$ ) 
- Used RSE and 𝑅2 to assess the fit of our least squares regression line

```{r}
Advertising
lm(fomrula = sales ~ TV, data = Advertising)
```
```{r}
lm(sales ~ TV)
```

```{r}
Advertising_1 = read.csv("/Users/roberthaire/Google Drive/Spring 2021/CAP4773 - Data Science/Advertising.csv")
Advertising_1
```
```{r}
lm(formula = sales ~ TV, data = Advertising)
```

- Alternatively, remember that we can drop the `data` argument by first placing the features in `Advertising` into our environment:
```{r}
attach(Advertising_1)
lm.fit = lm(formula = sales~TV)
 
```

```{r}
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(TV = c(1000)))
```
