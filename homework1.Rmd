Second, we will examine the relationship between the percentage of students from the top 10% of their high school class and the out-of-state tuition at a college. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## 2.a 
Create a scatterplot with the percentage of students from the top 10% of their high school class on the x axis and the out-of-state tuition on the y axis. Overlay the points with a smoothed line and 95% confidence bands. Remember to avoid overplotting. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = College) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Top10perc, y = Outstate)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Top10perc, y = Outstate), level = 0.95)
```

## 3.a
[10 points] Using different colored points for public and private colleges, create a scatterplot with the percentage of students from the top 10% of their high school class on the x axis and the out-of-state tuition on the y axis. Overlay each set of points with a smoothed line of the same color with 95% confidence bands. Remember to avoid overplotting. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = College, mapping = aes(x = Top10perc, y = Outstate)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Private)) + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = College, mapping = aes(x = Top10perc, y = Outstate, color = Private)) + geom_point(position = 'jitter') + geom_smooth(level = 0.95)
```

## 3.b
Using faceting, create side-by-side scatterplots for public and private schools, with the number of students from the top 10% of their high school class on each x axis and the out-of-state tuition on each y axis. Overlay each scatterplot with a smoothed line with 95% confidence bands. Remember to avoid overplotting. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = College, mapping = aes(x=Top10perc, y=Outstate)) + geom_jitter() + facet_wrap(~ Private, ncol = 2) + geom_smooth()
```
